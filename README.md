A language learning game that uses word lists to train your memorization in an interactive way

This is a small Unity "game" to help aid memorization and recognition for language students.

 It works similar to the popular 2048, and uses text files of words as input, which you have to link together in an interactive way. It works great for Japanese (Kanji, Hiragana and translation) but it can be used for any list of things really. I frequently just use it to train my Kanji to Hiragana memorization.

I’m currently still enrolled in a Japanese language BA course and haven’t really found the time to take on any programming ventures lately. During the rare one week of holiday between exams and the start of the second semester, I wanted to create something small that I knew would actually get finished. It was also a great opportunity to blend the two together, and the first time I had to deal with localization aspects (and JSON to store it) 

In truth it's pretty boring but it might make for a nice change of pace from always using Anki. This app acts as an extension of Anki in a way as you can export your Anki decks to text files and these should be readily compatible.

This project contains both source files, asset files, example text files (Japanese understanding might be required) and a working build.
The free sound effects used are from https://freesound.org

Feel free to play around with this, and don't hesitate to contact me!
